# Ensure Custom Role is assigned for Administering Resource Locks (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Resource locking is a powerful protection mechanism that can prevent inadvertent modification/deletion of resources within Azure subscriptions/Resource Groups and is a recommended NIST configuration.

## Rationale:

Given the resource lock functionality is outside standard Role Based Access Control(RBAC), it would be prudent to create a resource lock administrator role to prevent inadvertent unlocking of resources.
