# Ensure that Vulnerability Assessment (VA) is enabled on a SQL server by setting a Storage Account (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Enable Vulnerability Assessment (VA) service scans for critical SQL servers and corresponding SQL databases.

## Rationale:

Enabling Azure Defender for SQL server does not enable Vulnerability Assessment capability for individual SQL databases unless storage account is set to store the scanning data and reports. 

The Vulnerability Assessment service scans databases for known security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data. Results of the scan include actionable steps to resolve each issue and provide customized remediation scripts where applicable. Additionally, an assessment report can be customized by setting an acceptable baseline for permission configurations, feature configurations, and database settings.
