# Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

The TLS(Transport Layer Security) protocol secures transmission of data over the internet using standard encryption technology. Encryption should be set with the latest version of TLS. App service allows TLS 1.2 by default, which is the recommended TLS level by industry standards, such as PCI DSS.

## Rationale:

App service currently allows the web app to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. It is highly recommended using the latest TLS 1.2 version for web app secure connections.
