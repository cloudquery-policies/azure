# Ensure that 'OS and Data' disks are encrypted with CMK (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Ensure that OS disks (boot volumes) and data disks (non-boot volumes) are encrypted with CMK.

## Rationale:

Encrypting the IaaS VM's OS disk (boot volume), Data disks (non-boot volume) ensures that the entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. CMK is superior encryption although it requires additional planning.
